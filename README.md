Hello! Thank you for taking a look at my repository.

This is a personal project I created on June 22, 2020 that attempts to recreate the popular mobile game "Flappy Bird," created by Dong Nguyen and published by .Gears, using the limited knowledge of Python and Pygame I had at the time. Admittedly, this was also an attempt to impress my Intro to Robotics teacher at the time.
This program is based on "Shooting Game," which was a project assigned by my teacher around the end of the school year. While I did not do much exploring and adventuring outside of what he had taught us for that program, I am still proud of my ability to apply that knowledge and create something that resembled the game I was recreating.

This project is rough. VERY rough. The gravity of the bird is incredibly difficult to control, there are no animations, there are no sounds, and there is no way of conveniently restarting the game. In addition to all of that, the start screen is a white screen with text on it.

In my opinion, it is not much of an impressive project because of these short comings, but as I stated before, I am still proud of the meaning behind it. Had I not moved on from Python to C++ when transitioning into college, I may have created more projects like this one.

This repo contains six files:

* main.py, which is the main file that the game will run on
* background.png, which is an image file that serves as the background for the game
* base.png, which serves as the sprite for the ground
* bottom pipe.png, which serves as the sprite for the, you guessed it, bottom pipe
* top pipe.png, which serves as the sprite for the, you guessed it yet again, top pipe
* yellowbird0.png, which serves as the sprite for the bird you control

ALL IMAGES ARE PROPERTY OF DONG NGUYEN AND .GEARS. I DID NOT CREATE THESE IMAGES, NOR DO I OWN THEM.

This post is dedicated to my Algebra I and Intro to Robotics teacher, Christopher Chatergoon, who made learning both subjects an absolute joy, and who gave me the introduction to the realm of programming that I wish everybody could have.
(He is not dead, he just played a huge role in my high school career)
